**Subcontrol Text**

Ensure that there are written incident response plans that defines roles of personnel as well as phases of incident handling/management.

**Measures**

* r_i = # of defined role for incident handling in phase i
* R_i = # of total required role for incident handling in phase i  
* w_i = criticality of phase i in incident handling
* n = # of total phase for incident handling

**Metrics/KEI**

* Incident Plan Quality = ( SUM over i:1 to n ( (r_i / R_i) / w_i) / SUM over i:1 to n ( w_i) )
