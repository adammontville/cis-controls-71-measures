**Subcontrol Text**

Ensure that each of the organization's key systems are backed up as a complete system, through processes such as imaging, to enable the quick recovery of an entire system.

**Measures**

* M1 = # of backed system / # of total system
* M2 = (SUM i to N (backUpSize_i / total_capacity_i)) / N


**Metrics/KEI**

* Efficiency of backup = M1 * M2
