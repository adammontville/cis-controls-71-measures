**Subcontrol Text**

Ensure that the organization's security awareness program is updated frequently (at least annually) to address new technologies, threats, standards and business requirements.

**Measures**

* w_i = weights of each category to be introduced
* I_i = # of items introduced from category i
* p_j = # of items collected or proposed of category j
* M1 = Current time
* M2 = last update time
* M3 = Max allowed time without update

**Metrics/KEI**

* AP Quality = ( (sum from i:1 to 4 ((l_i / p_i) * w_i)) ) / (sum from i:1 to 4(w_i))
* Freshness of Awareness program = (M1 - M2) / M3
