**Subcontrol Text**

Ensure that backups are properly protected via physical security or encryption when they are stored, as well as when they are moved across the network [traffic]. This includes remote backups and cloud services.

**Measures**

* How important encryption, E = [0, 1]
* M1 = (SUM i to N (baked i / capacity i)) / N
* M2 = (SUM i to N ((baked i / capacity i) * E i)) / N


**Metrics/KEI**

* Importance of back up =  M2/ M1
