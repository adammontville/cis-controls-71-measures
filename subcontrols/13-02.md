**Subcontrol Text**

Remove sensitive data or systems not regularly accessed by the organization from the network. These systems shall only be used as stand alone systems (disconnected from the network) by the business unit needing to occasionally use the system or completely virtualized and powered off until needed.

**Measures**

* V_i = vulnerability score of machine i
* A_i = Asset value of machine i
* d = damping factor(exploiting nearest machine in the path will have high impact) 0 < d < 1
* n = path length
* M1 = accessibility time
* T = total time in consideration

**Metrics/KEI**

* Impact of machine_i, I(i) = V_i * A_i + SUM over j:1 to n ( (d^j) * I(j) )
* Regularity = M1 / T (if less than or equal threshold ok, otherwise bad)
