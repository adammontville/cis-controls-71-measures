**Subcontrol Text**

Deny communication over unauthorized TCP or UDP ports or application traffic to ensure that only authorized protocols are allowed to cross the network boundary in or out of the network at each of the organization's network boundaries.


**Measures**

* # of total unauthorized TCP/UDP ports(using formal analytics) = M1 = 2 * SUM from 𝑖=1 to n(# 𝑜𝑓 𝑢𝑛𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑑 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡 𝑖𝑛 𝑏𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑟𝑦 𝑑𝑒𝑣𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑖)
* M2= # of sent unique(in terms of port and device) probe
* M3 = # of total unauthorized TCP/UDP ports(using formal analytics)
* M4 = #of detected traffic to unauthorized TCP/UDP port
* # of whitelisted application


**Metrics/KEI**

* Measuring the detectability of connections to unauthorized TCP or UDP ports Coverage = M2/ M3
* Quality Measure(Detectability) =M4/M3
* Same as TCP/UDP port
