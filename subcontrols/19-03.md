**Subcontrol Text**

Designate management personnel, as well as backups, who will support the incident handling process by acting in key decision-making roles.

**Measures**

* m_i = # of designated management personnel for key decision-making in phase i
* M_i = # of total required management personnel for key decision-making in phase i  
* b_i = # of designated management back-up  personnel for key decision-making in phase i
* B_i = # of total required management  back-up personnel for key decision-making in phase i  
* w_m_i = criticality of designating managemnet personal in phase i
* w_b_i = criticality of designating managemnet back-up personal in phase i
* n = # of total phase for incident handling

**Metrics/KEI**

* Quality of Incident handling process = ( (SUM over i:1 to n (  ( (m_i / M_i) * w_m_i + (b_i / B_i) * w_b_i) ) /  SUM over i:1 to n (w_m_i + w_b_i) )  / n
