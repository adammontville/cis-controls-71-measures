**Measures**

* c_i_j= # of correct answer for employee j in round i
* TQ_i_j = # of total question for employee j in round i
* n = # of total employee randomly picked
* m = # of round
* alpha = damping factor(more recent round will have higher weight) < 1

**Metrics/KEI**

* TP Quality = ( SUM over j: 1 to n ( (SUM over i:0 to m-1 ( (c_i_j / TQ_i_j) * alpha^i ) ) / (SUM over i:0 to m-1 (alpha^i ) ) ) ) / n
