**Subcontrol Text**

Ensure that all backups have at least one backup destination that is not continuously addressable through operating system calls.??? do you mean isolated or unreachable from the rest of the network?

**Measures**

* How important encryption, E = [0, 1]
* M1 = (SUM i to N (baked i / capacity i)) / N
* M2 = (SUM i to N ((baked i / capacity i) * E i)) / N


**Metrics/KEI**

* Importance of back up =  M2/ M1
