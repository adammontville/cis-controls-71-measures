# Terminology

A placeholder to define common methods of defining globally-used terms within the Controls Assessment Specification.

*INPUTS*
*NOTE* We decided to use the _expanded_ form of the term throughout the document rather than the abbreviated version of the term.
* Endpoint Inventory: Current hardware inventory wich includes physical and virtual resources; 1.4
* Authorized Software List: List of software approved for use in the enterprise; 2.1
* Software-capable Endpoints: The set of endpoints found in the Endpoint Inventory capable of running installed software; derived from 1.4
* Software Inventory: An inventory of all software instances installed in the enterprise; 2.4
* Security Configuration Standards: Enterprise security configuration standards; 5.1
* Key Systems: "Key systems" (potentially interpreted as "critical systems"); 10.2
* Boundary Device Inventory: An invenotry of devices defining enterprise network boundaries, derived from the Endpoint Inventory; 12.1
* Classification Scheme: The organization's information classification scheme (derived from 13.1 - Maintain an Inventory of Sensitive Information)
* Sensitive Information Inventory: The enterprise inventory of sensitive data; 13.1
* Incident Response Plan: The enterprise policy governing incident response; 19.1

*NOTATION*
*

*CHECKLIST*

* Measures are well-defined (make sure measure steps are atomic)
* Ensure non-compliant lists are included
* Ensure metrics are presented in a positive frame
* Ensure checks are Level 1
* For IG-1, ensure recommended values are included
* Align input values for global reuse (when you find a new one, add it above with the sub-control identification)
* Check for sub-control dependencies (should be easier as we build out previous bullet)
