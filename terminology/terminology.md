# Terminology

A placeholder to define common methods of defining globally-used terms within the Controls Assessment Specification.

*INPUTS*
* EI: Current hardware inventory; 1.4
* ASL: Authorized software list; 2.1
* SCE: Software-capable endpoints; derived from 1.4
* SI: Software Inventory
* SCS: Enterprise security configuraiton standards
* KS: "Key systems" (potentially interpreted as "critical systems"); 10.2
* BDI: Boundary device inventory; 12.1
* CS: Organization's information classification scheme

*NOTATION*
*

*CHECKLIST*

* Measures are well-defined (make sure measure steps are atomic)
* Ensure non-compliant lists are included
* Ensure metrics are presented in a positive frame
* Ensure checks are Level 1
* For IG-1, ensure recommended values are included
* Align input values for global reuse (when you find a new one, add it above with the sub-control identification)
* Check for sub-control dependencies (should be easier as we build out previous bullet)
